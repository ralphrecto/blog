- *Seeing Like a State*, James C. Scott
- *Convenience Store Woman*, Sayaka Murata
- __*Beautiful World, Where Are You*__, Sally Rooney
    - My favorite Sally Rooney book so far. It does make me wonder what she will write next, since she has been writing about fairly similar characters and concerns for all of her books. Maybe her characters will slowly age along with her?
